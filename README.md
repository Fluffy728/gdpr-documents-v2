GDPR is important because it improves the protection of European data subjects' rights and clarifies what companies that process personal data must do to safeguard these rights.

## Motivation

After [one of the Equifax data breaches](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/equifax-breach-preventable-house-oversight-report/) & one year after feared GDPR came into force, a team of lawyers decided to explore the state of data protection of European banks & credit scoring entities. At first, we researched available GDPR requests but found next to nothing. The vast majority of information advises companies on how to fend off personal data inquiries. This saddened us, as financial institutions gather massive amounts of detailed information about us. We expected that more people would want to execute their right to know. To shift this imbalance a little, we created our request templates. Currently is available "Data Access" request & Data Erase in 8 European languages.
